	 * Suppose there are n people standing in a circle and they are numbered 1

	 * He then passes the sword to the next person still standing, in this case

	 * person 5. This pattern continues around and around the circle until just
	 * one person remains.

	 * 
	 * What is the number of this person?

	 * 1 kills 2, passes to 3. 3 kills 4, passes to 5. 5 kills 1, passes to 3. 3
	 * kills 5 and wins.

	 * Output → integer : index of the last person standing
